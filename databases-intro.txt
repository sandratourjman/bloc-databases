> 2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: A database would be used if there are multiple users reading, updating, or deleting the same file. In order for all the information to be up-to-date when each person is looking at the file, a database would be the way to go so that changes made are at the source and not saved upon closing the text file. A text file would be used when it's being accessed and maintained by a single user. 


> 3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is a declaritive language rather than a procedural language like other programming languages. What that means is that SQL is concerned with getting the data we want, rather than how to go about it like with algorithms. If you need to pull the last 50 entries in a database, you can literally declare what you want and the database will be queried and return the results.

> 4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: A database is an application in which a user can records of data through an interface. Databases allow you to store more information within each record than what you can with an array. To retrieve data from a database, a special language called SQL is used. Multiple users can query the database at the same time unlike text files. 

> 5. Explain the meaning of **table**, **row**, **column**, and **value**.

A: A table is the structure in whcih information is stored within a database. When we query a database, we have to explicit state which table that is holding the information we need. A table is made up of a collec tion of rows and columns, and those row/column intersections contain cells which hold values. A row represents a single record within the table. Say you had a customers table that held info about a customer like their name, email, and phone number. When an entry is made to the table, that single entry is stored in a row. A column defines what the data represents. In our customer table example, a customer's email would be a column. A value or cell is a particular value that intersects the row/column. jane.doe@gmail.com would be an email for the customer Jane Doe. That would be a value or cell. 

> 6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: Three data types that can be used in a table are string, integer, and date. 

> 7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

> 8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

Table: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/iQAEYktwysXqcLQHv2dwbc/0

A: 

> The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
